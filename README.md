# moviereservation
This is a simple, not efficient movie theater reservation system.
The project has not been documented well but I will ensure that I will document it in the future.
To make it work on your PC:
install and run xampp
import the sql database saved as sql_3.sql into phpmyadmin whose database is named "logintable" (sorry for choosing a very confusing name for a database)
save the rest of the files in htdocs folder of xampp
open you web browser and type the URL along the lines of:localhost/<name>
here name is the name of the folder where you have saved the files in htdocs (if there are more folders within it then specify the location from htdocs)
